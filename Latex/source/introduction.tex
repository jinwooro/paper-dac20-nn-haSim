\section{Introduction}
Many \acp{CPS} are inherently safety-critical as they operate closely with human. Typical examples include implantable medical devices, and autonomous vehicle systems. 

Key points:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For validation, systems are tested through real experiments. E.g., pacemakers are tested using real heart, and vehicular systems are tested using real cars.
	\item However, preparing real experiment is extremely expensive, and limited by ethics and legislation. E.g., we cannot get real hearts easily. 
	\item Thus, a device which can mimic the plant (i.e., heart/vehicle part) is desired. This poses the need for executing the model on hardware. 
	\item Traditionally, \acp{CPS} are modelled using \ac{HA}. Ensuring zero-crossing detection is fundamental for correct operation.
	\item Zero-crossing detection algorithm is based on root-finding methods, which are computationally heavy to be deployed on hardware.
	\item Thus, this paper proposes to replace the zero-crossing detection algorithm with neural networks.
\end{enumerate}
